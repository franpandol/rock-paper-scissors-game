# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
## Overview

This Rock-Paper-Scissors game is an interactive simulation built with Python and Pygame. It features a dynamic environment where 100 objects representing rock, paper, or scissors move around a 2D space, interact according to the classic game rules, and change their types based on these interactions.
Features

    Dynamic Interactions: Objects representing rock, paper, and scissors interact with each other based on the classic game's rules.
    Movement and Collision: Each object moves randomly within the game area, with collision detection that leads to interactions.
    Conversion Logic: Upon collision, the losing object (based on rock-paper-scissors rules) changes its type to the winning object's type.

## Getting Started

To run the game, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed. Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the main game file:

```bash

git clone git@github.com:youruser/rock-paper-scissors-game.git
